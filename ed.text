Introduction

External DNS is a powerful tool used to manage DNS records dynamically for resources in Google Cloud. In the context of Istio, External DNS can be leveraged to update DNS records based on the configuration of Istio Virtual Services and Gateways. This document provides an overview of External DNS, discusses the placement options for DNS zones, and explains the required permissions when using External DNS with Istio.

1. What is External DNS?

External DNS is a Kubernetes-based project that automates the management of DNS records for cloud resources. It allows you to map domain names to your resources dynamically by monitoring the Kubernetes resources and making DNS changes accordingly. With External DNS, you can simplify the management of DNS records and ensure that they are always up-to-date.

Title: Understanding External DNS in Google Cloud

1. Introduction

External DNS is a service that automatically manages DNS records for your applications and services. It provides a convenient way to map domain names to the corresponding IP addresses of your resources. In Google Cloud, you can leverage Google Cloud DNS as your external DNS provider. Google Cloud DNS is a scalable, reliable, and managed DNS service offered by Google.

2. DNS Zones Placement Options

There are two options for placing DNS zones in Google Cloud:

   a. DNS zones in the same project as GKE
   
   Placing DNS zones in the same project as your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster offers several benefits. It simplifies management by keeping all resources within a single project, enables easier access control, and simplifies billing.

   To create DNS zones in the same project as your GKE cluster, follow these steps:
   
   - Step 1: Open the Google Cloud Console.
   - Step 2: Select your project and navigate to the Cloud DNS page.
   - Step 3: Click "Create Zone" to create a new DNS zone.
   - Step 4: Provide the required information, such as the zone name, DNS name, and DNSSEC options.
   - Step 5: Save the configuration to create the DNS zone.

   b. DNS zones in a different project
   
   Placing DNS zones in a different project provides a separation of concerns and allows for more granular access control. This can be useful when you want to manage DNS zones separately from your GKE cluster or share DNS zones across multiple projects.

   To create DNS zones in a different project than your GKE cluster, follow these steps:
   
   - Step 1: Open the Google Cloud Console.
   - Step 2: Select the project where you want to create the DNS zone.
   - Step 3: Navigate to the Cloud DNS page.
   - Step 4: Click "Create Zone" to create a new DNS zone.
   - Step 5: Provide the required information, such as the zone name, DNS name, and DNSSEC options.
   - Step 6: Save the configuration to create the DNS zone.
   
   
   
   a. DNS zones in the same project as GKE:

Pros:

Simplified management: Having DNS zones in the same project as your GKE cluster provides a consolidated view of resources, making it easier to manage and organize your infrastructure.
Access control: With DNS zones in the same project, you can leverage project-level IAM roles and permissions to control access to both the GKE cluster and the DNS zones.
Billing simplicity: By keeping DNS zones in the same project, it simplifies the billing process as all resources are billed together in one project.
Cons:

Limited separation of concerns: Placing DNS zones in the same project as GKE means that all resources are tightly coupled within a single project, which may not be ideal if you want to separate management or share DNS zones across multiple projects.
Potential complexity for multi-project setups: If you have a complex infrastructure involving multiple projects, managing DNS zones in the same project as GKE might lead to increased complexity and potential challenges in resource organization and access control.
b. DNS zones in a different project:

Pros:

Separation of concerns: Placing DNS zones in a different project allows for clear separation between your GKE cluster and the DNS management. This can be beneficial for isolating responsibilities and managing resources independently.
Granular access control: Managing DNS zones in a different project enables fine-grained access control, allowing you to assign specific IAM roles and permissions to users or service accounts responsible for DNS management.
Resource sharing: If you have multiple projects that require access to the same DNS zones, placing the DNS zones in a dedicated project allows for easier sharing and management across projects.
Cons:

Increased administrative overhead: Managing DNS zones in a different project introduces additional administrative overhead, as you need to navigate between multiple projects for configuration and management.
Potentially complex access setup: Granting the necessary permissions for accessing DNS zones in a different project requires careful configuration and coordination between projects, which may increase the complexity of your setup.

3. Granting Permissions for External DNS

To manage DNS zones effectively, you need to grant appropriate permissions. Google Cloud offers different options for granting permissions, including Workload Identity and Worker Node Google Service Account (GSA).

   a. Workload Identity
   
   Workload Identity is a recommended approach for granting permissions to GKE workloads. By configuring Workload Identity, you can associate a Kubernetes service account with a Google Cloud IAM service account, allowing the workload to access resources securely.

   To configure Workload Identity for DNS zone access, follow these steps:
   
   - Step 1: Enable Workload Identity for your GKE cluster.
   - Step 2: Create a Google Cloud IAM service account.
   - Step 3: Associate the Kubernetes service account with the Google Cloud IAM service account.
   - Step 4: Assign the necessary IAM roles to the Google Cloud IAM service account.

   b. Worker Node GSA (Google Service Account)
   
   Worker Node GSA is an alternative approach for granting permissions to GKE workloads. It involves assigning a Google Service Account to the worker nodes in your GKE cluster.

   To assign permissions using Worker Node GSA, follow these steps:
   
   - Step 1: Create a Google Service Account with the necessary IAM roles.
   - Step 2: Generate a JSON key file for the Google Service Account.
   - Step 3: Configure the GKE cluster to use the Google Service Account by specifying the `--service
   
   c. Static Credentials

Alternatively, you can use static credentials to access DNS zones in a different project. This approach involves creating and managing a service account key with the necessary permissions and using it to authenticate with the Google Cloud API.

To use static credentials for accessing DNS zones in a different project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a Google Service Account in the project where the DNS zone is hosted.
Step 2: Assign the required IAM roles to the Google Service Account, such as the dns.admin role for managing DNS zones.
Step 3: Generate a JSON key file for the Google Service Account.
Step 4: In your GKE cluster, create a Kubernetes Secret to store the JSON key file securely.
Step 5: Configure your external DNS provider (such as ExternalDNS or CoreDNS) to use the Kubernetes Secret for authentication.
By using static credentials, you can securely authenticate and access DNS zones in a different project without relying on Workload Identity or Worker Node GSAs. However, ensure that you follow best practices for managing and securing the JSON key file to maintain the integrity of your credentials.

Remember to choose the placement option that aligns with your specific requirements and consider factors such as management simplicity, access control, and resource organization.

Please note that the Static Credentials option mentioned here assumes the use of an external DNS provider such as ExternalDNS or CoreDNS. The specific steps may vary depending on the chosen provider and its integration with Google Cloud.

4. Required Permissions for External DNS

To manage DNS zones effectively, certain permissions are required based on the chosen placement option.

   a. DNS zones in the same project as GKE
   
   When using DNS zones in the same project as your GKE cluster, ensure that the Kubernetes service accounts have the following permissions:
   
   - `dns.changes.create` and `dns.changes.get` on the DNS zone resource
   - `dns.managedZones.get` on the project

   b. DNS zones in a different project
   
   When using DNS zones in a different project, ensure that the Kubernetes service accounts have the following permissions:
   
   - `dns.changes.create` and `dns.changes.get` on the DNS zone resource
   - `dns.managedZones.get` on the DNS zone resource's project
   - `dns.projects.get` on the target project where the DNS zone is hosted




For DNS zones in the same project as GKE, the minimum required permissions are:

dns.changes.create and dns.changes.get on the DNS zone resource: These permissions allow the service accounts to create and retrieve DNS record changes within the DNS zone.
dns.managedZones.get on the project: This permission enables the service accounts to retrieve information about the DNS zone itself, such as its configuration.
For DNS zones in a different project, the minimum required permissions are:

dns.changes.create and dns.changes.get on the DNS zone resource: These permissions allow the service accounts to create and retrieve DNS record changes within the DNS zone.
dns.managedZones.get on the DNS zone resource's project: This permission enables the service accounts to retrieve information about the DNS zone itself in the project where the DNS zone is hosted.
dns.projects.get on the target project where the DNS zone is hosted: This permission allows the service accounts to retrieve information about the target project, which is necessary to access the DNS zone hosted in that project.
